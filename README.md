Below is a coherent, five-stage roadmap for the next 12–18 months, with estimated timeframes and budgets:

---

## Stage 1: AI Model Optimization

**Duration:** 2–3 months
**Budget:** \$30 K

* **Goal:** Boost diabetic-retinopathy accuracy ≥ 85% and add hypertension/cardiac-risk outputs.
* **Tasks:**

  * Fine-tune foundation models (e.g., RETFound) on 5 000+ labeled scans.
  * Build a simple REST API for rapid EHR/telehealth integration.
* **Cost Breakdown:**

  * Cloud compute & GPU time: \$15 K
  * API development & devops: \$15 K

---

## Stage 2: Regulatory Pre-Submission

**Duration:** 1–2 months
**Budget:** \$20 K

* **Goal:** Achieve FDA Breakthrough Device pre-certification or CE Mark Lite.
* **Tasks:**

  * Engage a regulatory consultant.
  * Retrospective validation on EyePACS/UK Biobank datasets.
* **Cost Breakdown:**

  * Consultant fees: \$15 K
  * Compliance tooling & paperwork: \$5 K

---

## Stage 3: Telemedicine & Insurance Pilots

**Duration:** 3–4 months
**Budget:** \$50 K

* **Goal:** Run paid pilots with 2–3 telemed platforms and insurers.
* **Tasks:**

  * White-label API for telehealth vendors (e.g., Teladoc).
  * Configure insurer portals for “early-detection” add-ons.
* **Cost Breakdown:**

  * Integration development: \$30 K
  * Sales outreach & pilot support: \$20 K

---

## Stage 4: Hospital & Consumer Scale-Up

**Duration:** 6–9 months
**Budget:** \$200 K

* **Goal:** Onboard 10+ hospitals and launch a D2C mobile app.
* **Tasks:**

  * Clinical validation partnerships (e.g., Mayo Clinic).
  * Develop smartphone-adapter consumer app.
* **Cost Breakdown:**

  * Mobile/web development: \$80 K
  * Hardware prototype (scan adapters): \$50 K
  * Key sales hires & marketing: \$70 K

---

## Stage 5: Disease-Module Expansion

**Duration:** 6–12 months (overlaps Stages 3–4)
**Budget:** \$300 K

* **Goal:** Add Alzheimer’s & anemia detection.
* **Tasks:**

  * License multimodal datasets (retinal + labs/MRI).
  * Fine-tune models and upsell to existing clients.
* **Cost Breakdown:**

  * Data licensing: \$150 K
  * Additional AI training & validation: \$100 K
  * Legal/IP & partnership fees: \$50 K

---

### Total Investment & Timing

* **Overall Budget:** ≈ \$600 K
* **Timeline:** 12–18 months (Stages overlap for efficiency)

This phased approach balances rapid product improvement with careful validation, regulatory alignment, and market rollout—setting us up for scalable growth and early revenue from pilots through broad hospital and consumer adoption.
